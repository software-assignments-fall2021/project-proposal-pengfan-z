# Project Proposal

### Project title
Smart Choice

### What?
This is a web app that can help NYU students learning about the courses in an easy and powerful way. 

It will provide the original functionality of the NYU Albert Course Search with a simplier and beautiful user interface. 

Under each section of the course, the app will also provide extra information such as the rating of the course, comments, syllabus, etc. (all from users of this website) that NYU Albert cannot provide.

The courses can be selected and saved to a personalized account for future reviewing.

### Why?
The current NYU Albert Course Search interface seems messy and slow. It takes too much time to research the courses. Furthermore, students have to spend extra time browsing other websites like ratemyprofessor to read students' feedback. Therefore, a web app that can combine course search and students' feedback with a cleaner user interface can save students plenty of time to make a personalized course plan.

### For whom?
Most users will be the NYU students who want to learn more about the courses for their next semester. The prospective NYU first-year or transferred students can be the users too.

### How?
The course search function is open to the public. The website will support course search by typing course name or by selecting major.

The user can create an account to save their course choices so that it is faster for him/her to check those courses status and info. later. After logging in, the user can also share some useful information of the courses they took before by rating, commenting, uploading syllabus.

### Scope
Frontend will be really important for this project because we want the users to save time on course searching. Plus, the user interface should be more interactive with some consistent style. Bootstrap may be the framework we can use for the design.

We will mostly use the [Schedge API](https://github.com/BUGS-NYU/schedge) developed by BUGS-NYU for the course search function.

Therefore, the backend and database are more about the account part such as creating accounts, adding/deleting comments, rating, organizing these extra info., etc. It is also plenty of work to do here.
